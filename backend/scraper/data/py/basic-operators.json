        "explanation": "When both of the operands are integer then python chops out the fraction part and gives you the round off value, to get the accurate answer use floor division. This is floor division. For ex, 5/2 = 2.5 but both of the operands are integer so answer of this expression in python is 2. To get the 2.5 answer, use floor division."
