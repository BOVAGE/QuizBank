            "kernel is the first part of operating system to load into memory during booting",
            "kernel remains in the memory during the entire computer session"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "kernel is made of various modules which can not be loaded in running operating system",
        "explanation": "Kernel is the first program which is loaded in memory when OS is loading as well as it remains in memory till OS is running. Kernel is the core part of the OS which is responsible for managing resources, allowing multiple processes to use the resources and provide services to various processes. Kernel modules can be loaded and unloaded in run-time i.e. in running OS."

        ],
        "correct_answer": "to get and execute the next user-specified command",
        "explanation": "The main function of command interpreter is to get and execute the next user-specified command. Command Interpreter checks for valid command and then runs that command else it will throw an error."
